# termania
A highly portable version of DDR/Stepmania for Mac/Unix terminals to play on the go.

### Supported features
- Tap, hold, roll, and mine notes
- Semi-compliant SM file format parser
- Dynamic BPM changes (XMod)
- Negative BPMs/stops (as defined by SM)
- Adjustable scroll factor (aka beat spacing, thus apparent speed)

## Installation & Usage
In the project directory:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py <path_to_song_folder> [<scroll_factor>]
```

You may need to enable input permissions during usage.
If the chart doesn't load, ensure that the "#MUSIC" tag in the SM file uses the correct music filename/path.

### Controls
- Esc: Toggle pause
- Backspace: Exit program
- D, F, J, K: Default 4K key mappings

## Technical Notes
### Design considerations
Graphics is purely text-based, since sixel is unsupported on the default terminal for Mac and GNOME.
For the same reason, colour space should be 8-bit and should only use ASCII for consistent width/support.

Python is fine because the Mac terminal refresh rate is the far greater bottleneck.
But the libraries should be kept minimal so that it is lightweight, easily rewritable for another language/application if needed, and as a learning experience.
As such:
- just_playback was used as a tiny audio engine for syncing all threads. Surprisingly well-supported at time of writing.
- pynput was used to overcome the limitations of a terminal's stdin.
- msdparser greatly simplifies MSD format parsing for SM, SSC and DWI.

Finally, it needs to be able to parse existing Stepmania charts into the internal format (at bare minimum, SM format, but eventually SSC and SSQ) to be realistically practical.

### Notable limitations
The vertical axis is the traditional, most intuitive play direction and also the easiest to draw in curses.
However, it is also the worst axis for gameplay because rendered chars are usually taller than wide, causing the illusion of flickering.
So while the original V^3 gimmick map works, it's not particularly recommended.
One option is to render thicker notes and increase the note spacing/speed to improve the illusion of steady note movement,
but the limited vertical resolution means this can only go so far (without a tall monitor or smaller char cell).

The limited resolution also means highly dense charts may not render quite as well on low scroll factors, as scroll=1 will round 16th+ notes to the same row while 12th-ish notes rely more on rhythm than visuals.

There is no easy way to change the actual note speed in XMod without affecting spacing, due to the beat-relative position formula. Current solutions are adjusting the scroll factor, modifying the chart BPMs, or maybe injecting the vel factor to a custom format reader at load time.

FFR forum post of old and current Stepmania charting exploits. Explanations are inaccurate/lacking, but the descriptions of expected behaviour were very helpful in reverse engineering the inner workings:

## Backlog (might move to Issues)
Todo:
- Extra CLI kwargs
  - Select specific chart index within song pack
  - Custom n-K key mapping
  - Possibly global input offset
  - Possibly disable some rendered features
- Stats/score HUD
  - Rolling or exponential accuracy ms display
  - NPS display
  - Simple graph for accuracy/NPS over time
  - Running judgement scoreboard
- Centering of game display, loading/results screens, etc
- Colours
  - Notes should be coloured by their measure fraction and judgement state
  - Measure lines can be made a less intrusive colour
  - Judgement colour scheme (maybe emulate DDR colours or by early/lateness)
- Constant speed via time-based rendering (CMod)
- SSC format parser
  - Must support WARP
  - Both SM/SSC should parse the less common aliases
- Custom format and its parser
  - Should allow true negative BPM as backrolling charts
- Variable-width notes and note skins
  - Probably requires a "canvas" buffer before cropped write
- Hitsounds/claps/explosions
- Live rewind/seek/loop section
- Live slow/pitch
  - Requires swapping out just_playback with unthreaded lib or raw
  - May need to custom handle time-stretch algorithm?
- Document theory more thoroughly, but maybe out of repo
- Move out name-main test cases into pytest

Won't do (any time soon):
- Dynamic scroll factors
- Explicit lift notes
  - Easy to implement in pynput, unfun to play
- DP scoring
- ANSI-based input
  - Would require no permissions
  - Holds work already with autorepeat rate tweaks, but rolls become redundant
  - Best left to a separate repo
- Chart search/navigator
  - Best left to a separate repo
